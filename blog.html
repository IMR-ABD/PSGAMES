                    <p>Reprise your role as a supernatural assassin in Dishonored 2! Play your way in a world where mysticism and industry collide. Will you choose to play as Empress Emily Kaldwin or the royal protector, Corvo Attano? Will you make your way through the game unseen, make full use of its brutal combat system, or use a blend of both? How will you combine your character's unique set of powers, weapons and gadgets to eliminate your enemies? The story responds to your choices, leading to intriguing outcomes, as you play through each of the game's hand-crafted missions.
Dishonored 2 is set 15 years after the Lord Regent has been vanquished and the dreaded Rat Plague has passed into history. An otherworldly usurper has seized Empress Emily Kaldwin’s throne, leaving the fate of the Isles hanging in the balance. As Emily or Corvo, travel beyond the legendary streets of Dunwall to Karnaca, the once-dazzling coastal city that holds the keys to restoring Emily to power. Armed with the Mark of the Outsider and powerful new abilities, track down your enemies and take back what’s rightfully yours.</p>

                    <h2>CALL OF DUTY: MODERN WARFARE REMASTERED REVIEW
                        <br>
                        <small>November 9, 2016</small>
                    </h2>
                    <p>[Editor’s Note: at the time of review, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered is only available as an add-on to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, and must be purchased as part of a bundle.]
Once held up as the great example for contemporary-era shooters, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is now an enlightening time capsule for an style of Call of Duty that no longer exists. When IGN first reviewed it back in 2007, we gave it a 9.4 and said this about it:
"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a fantastic game. The single-player experience is easily Infinity Ward's best work to date. Calling it intense may be an understatement. The overall story is standard action movie fare, but the relationships built over the short five hours of play are surprisingly strong. Though the single-player lacks length, the multiplayer should keep you invested in COD4 for the long winter. This is a truly fantastic multiplayer offering that's as deep as any other online game available..</p>
